Teach a Neural Network to Read Handwriting Neural networks and deep learning are two success stories in modern artificial intelligence. They’ve led to major advances in image recognition, automatic text generation, and even in self-driving cars.

To get involved with this exciting field, you should start with a manageable dataset.

The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge is the classic entry point. Image data is generally harder to work with than “flat” relational data. The MNIST data is beginner-friendly and is small enough to fit on one computer.

Handwriting recognition will challenge you, but it doesn’t need high computational power.

To start, we recommend with the first chapter in the tutorial below. It will teach you how to build a neural network from scratch that solves the MNIST challenge with high accuracy
